## Python Reference
My personal python code cheat-sheet, patterns, and best practices.

Python is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles.

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Verify python installation and version: `$ python --version`

If you have installed Python 3, but `$ python --version` outputs a Python 2 version, you also have Python 2 installed.
This is often the case on MacOS, and many Linux distributions. Use `$ python3` instead to explicitly use the Python 3 interpreter.
